                  Butterfly valves are a family of quarter-turn rotational

                  sealing properties. They are used in a wide variety of process
                  media and industries especially in water supply, collection,
                  and distribution, as well as pumping stations, and have a

                  motion valves that are used in pipelines to shut-off flow. It
                  is often said that butterfly valves can be used to regulate
                  the flow. However, we do not recommend doing this, as it can
                  damage the valve disk and have a negative effect on the
                  sealing properties. They are used in a wide variety of process
                  media and industries especially in water supply, collection,
                  and distribution, as well as pumping stations, and have a
                  broad range of use cases especially in flow isolation. A
                  couple of their key advantages over other valve families are
                  their simple construction and compactness, resulting in the
                  end products being of lighter weights and lower cost and with
                  smaller installation footprints and faster actuation speeds.

                  Hawle butterfly valves are flanged double eccentric type
                  (double offset) type. The double offset or eccentricity refers
                  to the fact that this valve design involves two offsets of the
                  disc from the valve body’s centre or the axis of rotation of
                  the stem.
